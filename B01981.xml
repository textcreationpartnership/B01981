         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore I the aforeſaid abuſed <hi>George Chamberlaine</hi> do hereby publiſh, declare, and make knowne to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the foreſaid <hi>Jone</hi> is my reall and lawfull wife, &amp; that the ſaid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was had, and ſolemnized between us according to the known lawes of this nation, &amp; by &amp; with the free and full conſent of her ſelfe the ſaid <hi>Maſſey</hi> her father in Law, &amp; her naturall mother, and before them and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and in a lawful Church, &amp; by a lawful Miniſter without force or fraud:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175547:10"/> for in truth before the ſaid marriage did take effect, I the ſaid <hi>George Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> did pay unto the ſaid <hi>Maſſey</hi> and his ſaid wife, in conſideration of the coſt that they had beene at in the education of my ſaid wife, the full and juſt ſum of five hundred pounds currant money, which the ſaid <hi>Maſſey</hi> and his ſaid wife received accordingly. Beſides I beſtowed above one hundred pounds currant moneys in apparrel &amp; other neceſſary accommodations for my ſaid wife: and therefore, through Gods aſſiſtance, I do ſpeedily reſolve to uſe all lawfull wayes and means to reduce my ſaid lawfull wife to her ſweet cohabitation with me, that we may live together in the feare of the Lord, and to gain her out of the hands of thoſe deſtroying flatterers, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed keeping man and wife aſunder, God will never bleſſe. I doe further declare ſincerely from my heart, that I never gave my ſaid dearly beloved wife any juſt cauſe, by word or deed, to withdraw her deſired ſelfe from my ſociety, but am reſolved by Gods Grace, faithfully to love and honour her, and plentifully to provide for her all the dayes of my life, according to Gods holy Laws and Commandements. And further I declare and publiſh my free reſolution by Gods Grace to paſſe by, and bury in eternall oblivion all former prejudices whatſoever, either by her tender too much creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or by her harkening more to the voice of flattery then the heart of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, nor ſhall I take advantage of any thing heretofore perpetrated by her mother or father in law againſt me, unto whom I ſhall yet have a civill and very tender regard, if complied withall in time, and ſhall obliterate all former unkindeneſſes, with theſe ſtrong weapons of true love and gentle courteſies, wherein I hope all perſons and power, both millitary and civill, underſtanding the candor and truth of the premiſſes will abhor to take part with thoſe, who moſt indirectly go about to ſeperate my ſelfe and my dearly beloved wife, whom God by his holy orders hath lawfully joyned together.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I do hereby further Declare, that from the day of the date hereof, I do give publick notice and warning to all people whatſoever, that they do not lend or truſt my ſaid Wife for any monies, wares, goods, or chattels, food, or raiment, or for any other thing whatſoever, without my Warrant and authority firſt had and obtained in writing, at their and every of their perils. All which I have beene moſt tenderly unwilling to declare to the world, but that I am inforced thereunto, by reaſon of thoſe malignant advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers that have a vaſt prevailing influence upon my Wife, and dayly go about to implunge her in great and vaſt debts, thereby to ſupply and bring about their wicked purpoſes, and contract great debts upon me to haſten my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, which they deſire.
